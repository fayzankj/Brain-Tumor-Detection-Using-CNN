- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization 📈.
- **Pandas**: For managing and analyzing the dataset.

### 2. 📂 **Dataset Configuration**
The dataset, containing brain tumor images categorized by tumor types, is prepared:
- **Training & Testing**: The images are organized into directories for training and testing phases.

### 3. 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**
We preprocess the dataset to make the images compatible with the model:
- **Resizing & Normalization**: Images are resized and normalized for efficient processing.
- **Class Distribution Visualization**: Understand the distribution of tumor types in the dataset.

### 4. 🔄 **Data Augmentation**
We apply various data augmentation techniques to enrich the training data:
- **Random Rotations** 🔄
- **Zooming In/Out** 🔍
- **Shifting & Flipping** ↔️

These techniques help to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization. 🌱

### 5. 🏗️ **Model Architecture**
The custom CNN model consists of several key layers:
